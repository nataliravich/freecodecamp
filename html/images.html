<!-- DESCRIPTION:
Step 1
You can add images to your website by using the img element. 
img elements have an opening tag without a closing tag. 
A tag for an element without a closing tag is known as a self-closing tag.
Add an img element below the p element. At this point, no image will show up in the browser.

Step 2
HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag of an element 
to control the element's behavior. 
The src attribute in an img element specifies the image's URL (where the image is located).
Inside the existing img element, add an src attribute with this URL:
https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg 

Step 3
All img elements should have an alt attribute. 
The alt attribute's text is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and 
is displayed if the image fails to load. 
For example, <img src="cat.jpg" alt="A cat"> has an alt attribute with the text A cat.
Inside the img element, add an alt attribute with this text:
A cute orange cat lying on its back
