<!-- DESCRIPTION:
Step 1
HTML5 has some elements that identify different content areas. 
These elements make your HTML easier to read and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) 
and accessibility.
Identify the main section of this page by adding a <main> opening tag before the h1 element, 
and a </main> closing tag after the p element.

Step 2
In the previous step, you put the h1, h2, comment, and p elements inside the main element. 
This is called nesting. Nested elements should be placed two spaces further to the right of the element 
they are nested in. 
This spacing is called indentation and it is used to make HTML easier to read.
The h1 element, h2 element and the comment are indented two spaces more than the main element
in the code below. 
Use the space bar on your keyboard to add two more spaces in front of the p element 
so that it is indented properly as well. -->

<body>
	<main>
		<h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
		<h2>Cat Photos</h2>
		<!-- TODO: Add link to cat photos -->
		<p>See more cat photos in our gallery.</p>
	</main>
</body>
