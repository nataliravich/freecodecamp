<!-- DESCRIPTION: 
Step 1
You can link to another page with the anchor (a) element. For example, <a href='https://freecodecamp.org'></a> 
would link to freecodecamp.org.
Add an anchor element after the paragraph that links to https://freecatphotoapp.com. 
At this point, the link wonâ€™t show up in the preview.

Step 2
A link's text must be placed between the opening and closing tags of an anchor (a) element. 
For example, <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">click here to go to freeCodeCamp.org</a> 
is a link with the text click here to go to freeCodeCamp.org.
Add the anchor text link to cat pictures to the anchor element. This will become the link's text.
	<a href="https://freecatphotoapp.com"></a>

Step 3
You can turn any text into a link, such as the text inside of a p element.
<p>I think <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp</a> is great.</p>
In the text of your p element, turn the words cat photos into a link by adding opening and closing anchor (a) tags around these words. Then set the href attribute to https://freecatphotoapp.com

   <a href="https://freecatphotoapp.com">link to cat pictures</a>

Step 4
Now that you turned the text cat photos inside the p element into a link, you don't need the second link below the p element. Delete the entire anchor element below the p element.

   <a href="https://freecatphotoapp.com">link to cat pictures</a>

Step 5
Add a target attribute with the value _blank to the anchor (a) element's opening tag, 
so that the link opens in a new tab.

Step 6
In previous steps you used an anchor element to turn text into a link. 
Other types of content can also be turned into a link by wrapping it in anchor tags.
Turn the image into a link by surrounding it with necessary element tags. 
Use https://freecatphotoapp.com as the anchor's href attribute value.
