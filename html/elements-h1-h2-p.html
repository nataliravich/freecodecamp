<!-- DESCRIPTION:
Step 1
HTML elements have opening tags like <h1> and closing tags like </h1>.
The text for an element goes between its opening and closing tags.
Find the h1 element and change its text to:
CatPhotoApp
<h1>Hello World</h1>

Step 2
The h1 through h6 heading elements are used to signify the importance of content below them. 
The lower the number, the higher the importance, so h2 elements have less importance than h1 elements. 
Only use one h1 element per page and place lower importance headings below higher importance headings.
Below the h1 element, add an h2 element with this text:
Cat Photos
<h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>

Step 3
The p element is used to create a paragraph of text on websites. 
Create a p element below your h2 element and give it the following text:
